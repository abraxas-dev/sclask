# sclask
Sclast is a learning project created to explore web scraping technology using Scrapy. The project demonstrates a scraper capable of doing auth on the board website. It extracts the latest number from the site and awards points based on user-entered values. Once 100 points are accumulated, the scraper automatically stops its activities.
